h2. Overview

Project aims to make working with multiple projects as simple as possible. By registering projects with workflows you can quickly create a set of commands that will be run against each project.



h2. Installation

The project is hosted on rubygems.org. Getting it is simple:

pre. gem install project

Once the gem is installed run:

pre. project install

Assuming you haven't already had the gem installed this will create a file at @~/.project@. This is the main configuration file used to drive project.



h2. Usage

Project uses a YAML file for its configuration. Edit the file located in at ~/.project to you liking.



h3. Projects

A project can be anything revolving around a particular context. A typical use case would be opening your default environment surrounding a particular project. An example project configuration might look like this:

pre.:name:
      :path: /path/to/project
      :workflow: default

The only required key within a project is *workflow*. This is important as you need to tell project which workflow to apply against the project. Any other variables specified here will be passed through to a workflow (more on this below).



h3. Workflows

A workflow is a set of commands you want run against a particular project. An example workflow might look something like this:

pre.
  :default:
    - mate %path
    - cd %path && gitx

A workflow is just a YAML array of templated commands. Any variable used in a workflow will get looked up on the project that is running it. In the example above the %path variable has been replaced by the path specified within the project. Using this method you can quickly build up a set of common workflows to use against any project. At the moment each command within a workflow is run inside it's own sub shell. This means that *every command is isolated from the surrounding commands*, so instead of doing two commands as +cd /some/path+ and +rake+ you would do +cd /some/path && rake+.


h3. Running a project

Running a project is simple, just specify the name of the project you want to load and the workflow will run for it:

  project name



h2. Bugs

If you have any problems with Project, please file an issue at http://github.com/joshnesbitt/project/issues.



h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
